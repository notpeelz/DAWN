# DAWN Developer Guide
This is an introduction to DAWN for developers that want to understand how it works so that they can modify, fix, etc its behaviour.

## Component Overview
DAWN collects and shares information about the APs and clients in the network by using a number of standard components.  The below assumes it is running on an OpenWrt device.

Information about capability of the AP and current clients is discovered via the hostapd and iwinfo.  The task to do this is scheduled by a timer.

hostapd also shares information about potential clients that are trying to connect, as received in 802.11 PROBE, AUTH and ASSOC requests, plus BEACON frames for 802.11k capable devices.

Communication with hostapd is via UBUS messages and callbacks.

This data is then exchanged with other DAWN instances that have been discovered via uMDNS. This means that every DAWN instance has a list of all clients and APs in the network, plus which APs have seen a clients (even if it is not a client).  The most tested and stable method of doing this is via TCP.  There are options for multicast and broadcast, but these are less tested and may fail.

Internally to DAWN these sets of data are stored as linked lists, which allow scalability while ensuring that memory usage is reduced in a small network.  Additional timers are used to remove "expired" data from these lists, so only a reasonably recent set is retained.

Another timer triggers periodically to ask the AP to look at each locally connected client and see if a better AP might be available.  This is achieved by calculating a score for every AP that has a recent BEACON or PROBE entry for the client based on signal strength, band, etc.  The scoring mechanism is  described in the Configuration page.

If one or more other APs have a sufficiently better score then the current AP the device is asked to move using an 802.11 frame that DAWN requests (via UBUS) hostapd to send.  For an 802.11v capable device a Disassociation Imminent frame is sent to encourage it to select one of the better APs in a DAWN generated Neighbor Report.  For pre-802.11k devices a Deauthentication can be forced [TODO: Check this].

Additionally, for an 802.11k capable AP DAWN will use the BEACON reports from other APs to create a Neighbor Report for the AP.  For instance if clients CL-A, CL-B and CL-C of AP-X report that they have reasonable signal strength to AP-M, AP-Q and AP-T then the NR for AP-X will be AP-M + AP-Q + AP-T.  Other APs in the network that those clients can't see will not be in the NR.

# Creating a DAWN Development Environment

The code base for the main DAWN applicaton is C.  It makes heavy use of pointers and pointer related structures such as linked lists.  Although it is a single executable there are multiple code entry points that are used by callback functions, etc. Familiarity with C memory management, simple event based programming and resource management in a multi-threaded application is a baseline for working effectively with the code.

## Compiling DAWN

This section describes how to add tha currently published version of DAWN to a local OpenWrt build environment, so that you can add DAWN to locally built firmware images or the Image Builder target.  It assumes you have some familiarity with building OpenWrt, so is more of an "aide memoir" than specific steps. In other words, just copying and pasting the below will not work!

Clone Openwrt

    https://git.openwrt.org/openwrt/openwrt.git

Update Feeds

    ./scripts/feeds update -a

Install DAWN

    ./scripts/feeds install dawn

Add DAWN to the build (under `Network -> dawn`)

    make menuconfig

Compile

    make package/dawn/compile

## Creating a local DAWN development instance
This section describes how to configure the OpenWrt build environment to use an alternate source code version, so you can work on that code.  Do the above Compiling Dawn steps first.

Enable local source code (under `Advanced Configuration -> Enable package source-tree override`)

    make menuconfig

Now you need to clone DAWN, e.g. into your home directory

    git clone https://github.com/berlin-open-wireless-lab/DAWN.git ~/DAWN

You have to add now a symlink. In the openwrt branch do something like

    ln -s ~/DAWN/.git/ ~openwrt/feeds/packages/net/dawn/git-src

Now compile dawn

    make package/dawn/{clean,compile}

You should then be able to copy the dawn binary executable file to your device to test your changes.

## DAWN Quality Assurance

### Runtime Messages
Helper macros and functions are provied to assist with appropriate management of messages.  The general convention is to issue messages one of the following priorities:
- ERROR (0): A significant runtime failure, such as memory exhaustion or unexpected ability to write to a network socket.
- WARNING (0): An algorithmically unexpected event, such as no AP seeming to be the host for a client device.
- ALWAYS (0): An infrequent information message that a user or administrator will want to see, such as a device being kicked from one AP to another.
- INFO (1): Reasonably frequent messages that indicate normal operation, such as the arrival of hostapd messages.  The log should still be "user friendly" at this level.
- TRACE (2): Messages that help indicate why a decision or code path was taken.
- DEBUG (3): Verbose tracing of code paths, etc.

The minimum logging level (as specified in /etc/config/dawn) at which the priority appears is indicated, eg (0).

### Memory handling
There are wrappers for the standard C memory management functions malloc(), free(), etc.  These help ensure that memory allocation is managed correctly by building a list of resources that have been allocated but not released.

While DAWN is running sending a HUP signal to the process will generate a list of currently allocated blocks in the system log, visible with logread.

In a small network ony a few tens of blocks are needed.  A longer list may suggest a memory leak, and inspection of the list to find multiple items allocated at the same line of code may indicate where it is arising.

### MUTEX Handling
DAWN has a set of data lists that are accessed by code which is triggered by multiple event types (timer, network message, ubus message, etc). Because of this there is a chance that data could become corrupted by competing blocks of code, leading to invalid memory access, process faults, etc.  Access to these resources is therefore managed by POSIX Threads mutex objects.

These potential problems will not be seen on a platform that is highly non-preemptive, so to help track down mutex handling errors such as accessing a resource without an appropriate lock helper functions are available.  This helps ensure that when the same code is run on platforms which use pre-emptive scheduling it is less likely to hit threading bugs.

 dawn_mutex_require() can be used to indicate that a segment of code is accessing a resource that should be locked.  Often the lock should be taken by a "higher up" block of code, and if it hasn't been a runtime warning will appear in the system log.  Further messages in the logs from dawn_mutex_lock() and ..._unlock() can be used to help review threading issues, such as trying to take a lock twice, not at all, etc.

### Test Harness
In addition to the dawn binary another named test_storage is built by CMAKE.  This can be used to excercise the core data storage and scoring algorithms to ensure that expected behaviour occurs.  At the time of writing a number of *.script files exist that can be passed to test_storage, but these haven't necessrily been maintained as the code has evolved from when they were originally written.
